To compile you will need a working c compiler and make.

$ sudo make release

Why sudo? this is required to give permissions to the program, since only root root can
create RAW sockets, release will give the same permissions of /usr/bin/ping to pong.

USING:
    pong [target] [-f] [-t time_to_live]

OPTIONS:
    target 
        Host name/destination.

    -f 
        Flood ping. Send ECHO_REQUEST and wait for ECHO_REPLY. Without waiting for
        SLEEPTIME, which defaults to 1 second.

    -t 
        Set the time to live, defaults to 64.

    SIGINT 
        Ends the ping and prints results.
