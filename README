To compile you will need a working c compiler and make.

$ sudo make release

sudo is required to give permissions to the program, since only root can create RAW sockets. Or run it with:

$ sudo ./pong

USING:
    pong [target] [[-f] [-t time_to_live]]

OPTIONS:
    target
        Host name/destination.

    -f
        Flood ping. Send ECHO_REQUEST and wait for ECHO_REPLY. Without waiting for SO_RCVTIMEO, SO_SNDTIMEO and RCVTIMEO.

    -t
        Set the time to live, defaults to 64.

    SIGINT
        Ends the ping and prints results.
